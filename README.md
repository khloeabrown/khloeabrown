### Hello, Hello ðŸ‘‹

<p align="justify">I am <a href="https://khloeabrown.com/" target="_blank">Khloe</a>, a <strong>front-end developer</strong> learning the MERN stack with an eye for UI and a <strong>graphic designer</strong> creating effective and beautiful logos, brand identities, and marketing media.</p>

<p align="justify">When I'm not working on the cool stuff, <strong>I enjoy my time with friends playing video and board games, reading 1980s DC comics, or playing with my bearded dragon Jude</strong>.</p>

### Brief History
<p align="justify">My career started 6 years ago when I took the Programming and Software Design course offered at my high school. I learned the basics of many languages like .NET, C++ and Java but I loved the Web Design section the most. I took to learning outside the classroom and over my summer breaks to learn more and do better. <strong>I won awards in web design competitions and even programmer of the year.</strong> I went to college for Web and Multimedia Design where I excelled thanks to my dedicate and outside learning. I mentored friends and classmates because <strong>I love web design and to help others</strong>.</p>

### Skills
<p align="justify">You never stop learning they say - especially for web development I say. I know the basics of web design such as <strong>HTML, CSS and basic vanilla JavaScript</strong>. I also love to use <strong>Sass</strong> for my web projects. I use <strong>git and GitHub</strong> to manage my projects and repos. I'm learning (and re-learning): more advanced JS frameworks such as React and Vue, package managers like npm, bundlers like webpack and parcel and much more. I'm not going to stop anytime soon!</p>

### Extra Bits to Know
ðŸ›  I'm currently working: on more projects for my online Web Dev 101 classroom and some freelance client work.<br />
ðŸ“š I'm currently leaning: Vue.js to see if it could improve any projects I could make.<br />
ðŸ’¥ I'm game to talk about: DC comics, especially the 1980-2003 Teen Titans or any of the major universe events.<br />
